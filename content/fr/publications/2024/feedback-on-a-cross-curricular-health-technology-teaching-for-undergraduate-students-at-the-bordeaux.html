abstract: >-
  This paper introduces a new cross-disciplinary curriculum teaching in Health Technology (HT) for undergraduate students involved in five different disciplines, which are computer sciences, materials engineering, mechanics, electronics, and applied physics. The major insight is based on the integration of University Degrees (UDs) to educational programs of Bordeaux Institute of Technology (BIT) to empower students to customize their educational paths based on their individual projects and interests. To the best of authors knowledge, such personalized pathway opening up learning practices and breaking down preconceived stereotypes is unique in a French institute of technology. Focusing on the UD dedicated to HT, the new cross-curricular syllabus is introduced. Highlights are i) a project-based learning to promote student success and the development of soft and hard skills, and ii) the establishment of a partnership to bring together healthcare professionals and local authorities on identified needs in HT. Students' feedback, lessons learnt and on-going discussions finally conclude the paper.
